# Morningstar App
Morningstar is a dawn simulator consisting of a pulse-watch, a smart lamp and an app.

Pulse is monitored and used to detect a light sleep phase near the set wake-up time. The lamp then starts to brighten and leads to a comfortable awakening.

Wake-up time is set in a simple Android app.

The user can:
* set the wake-up time for each day of the week (by clicking on the button with corresponding day)
* set the wake-up time for every day of the week at once (by clicking on the button with the pencil-icon)
* enable and disable the clock for each day (long press on corresponding day)
* enable and disable the clock for every day (long press on pencil-icon)
